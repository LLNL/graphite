# Denoising thermal perturbation with equivariant models for atomic structure characterization


## Single-element denoiser

The demo of our first work on denoising single-element primitive phases such as BCC, FCC, HCP, and simple cubic is hosted here.


## Ice denoiser

The code for our second work targeting ice phases is currently at: https://github.com/feifzhou/ice_denoiser.
